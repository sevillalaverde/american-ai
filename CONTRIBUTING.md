# Contributing
- Fork → feature branch → PR to `main`
- Keep PRs focused; add tests when applicable
- Conventional commits (e.g., `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`)
- No secrets in code (.env is ignored)

## Local dev (when code repos are added)
- Node 20+, pnpm or npm
- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill required keys
